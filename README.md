A first full-fleged program :

-Functions to :
- Create a cypher(`code`) as a list of tuples, by matching a printable character to a random number 
- Encypt a string with `code` (`encode(string, code)`)
- Decrypt a string with `code` (`decode(string, code)`)
- Save/overwrite `code` in a pickle file (`save_code(code)`)
- Retrieve `code` from the pickle file (`load_code()`)

-A simple user interface as main loop
